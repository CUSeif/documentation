# COUNTER

**COUNTER** stands for Counting Online Usage of NeTworked Electronic Resources. It
is both a standard and the name of the governing body responsible for publishing
the related code of practice (CoP). The governing body represents a collaborative
effort of publishers and librarians whose collective goal is to develop and
maintain the standard (CoP) for counting the use of electronic resources in
library environments.

This document refers to the online tool developed by Libraries IT that simplifies
the aggregation and reporting of electronic resource usage data for University
Libraries.
